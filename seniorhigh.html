				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp During My <b>Senior High School</b>day's It was stressful because of Modules and Perfomance task lisud kaau labi na self learning because during gmeet time I cannot focus because of the noise in the house or tapulan lng jd ko maminaw lmao. I cannot describe mostly during my SHS day's because It was pandemic that year we cannot go outside the house because of Covid-19. In my Gr 12 day's It was fun that day's when my graduation is coming up but before that we go to school to practice our rehearsal graduation and for the first time I meet my classmate's that time I'm so happy because there are so friendly and we jam together after the rehearsal of our graduation. And finally the time that we graduate we are so happy that time and proud because we successfully graduated Senior High School batch 2020-2022 after our graduation we picture together at the stage and happily going home.</p>
