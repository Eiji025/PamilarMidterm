				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp During My <b> Junior High School</b>day's I join Boy Scout of the Philippine's (BSP) and I enjoy a lot because every year there 2 camping's among atinan, I join bsp since 2017 until I graduate in JHS but sad to say wala kaabut ug graduation because of pandemic. It was challenging every year because during my bsp day's there was a lot of activity in our school like programs, and we organized the school chuchuchu... Every after class we form in the gym because of upcoming camping so that we ready or prepare that we practice every single day. For example we practice like yell, drama's (Drama nga mag acting depende unsay theme sa camping na among i apply sa drama), marching, and etc. I enjoy a lot those day's expecially the camping and event's.</p>
