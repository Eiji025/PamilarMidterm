				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp During my <b>Elementary</b> day's is kinda sad during my Gr 6 days so fast forward because nakalimot na oks pag gr 1 to 5 mga happy moments to chuchuchu... So yeah grade 6 is sadded life to me because I was transfer at province because of my family problem between my father and aunt. Ff, So in my Elem days there was a friend nga dijd friend at the end because he bully and scare me after and after not physically but emotionally sometimes, So mao natu ge bully ko niya and there was a friend name Patrick, Permi ko niya labanan para katung nag bully nako dili ko hilabtan he always right there for me always. After graduation I said to him that thank you for helping me kay ug wala ka maundang jd kog skwela tungod lng nay mag bully nako and I promise to him someday if magkita mi I will return the favor that he gave it to me.
